# 2-Way Drag & Drop in React (using dnd-kit)

This project demonstrates a two-way drag and drop implementation in React using the dnd-kit library.

Unlike one-way drag and drop, the two-way setup is a bit more complex because it requires two drop zones:

One covering the existing draggable items, Another as the target zone for dropped items.
